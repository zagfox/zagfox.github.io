<h1>Leetcode 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</h1>

<p>You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.<br>
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.<br>
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.</p>

<h2>Brute Force</h2>
For each of the buy-sell pair, compute the profit.<br>
Time Complexity: O(N^2)<br>

<h2>Dynamic Programming</h2>
There are duplicates computation in the brute force approach. For number at i th position, it can store<br>
information of the highest price from day i to the last day.
<pre>
dp[i-1] = dp[i]      |  if num[i-1] <= dp[i]
dp[i-1] = num[i-1]   |  if num[i-1] >  dp[i]
</pre>

And the max profit answer is the maxium of dp[i] - num[i].

<h2>Code</h2>
<pre><code>
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int N = prices.length;
        if (N == 0) return 0;

        int max = prices[N-1];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = N-2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (max - prices[i] > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = max - prices[i];
            }
            if (prices[i] > max) {
                max = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
