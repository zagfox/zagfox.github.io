<h1>Leetcode 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II</h1>

<p>You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.<br>
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.<br>
Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
Unlike problem 121, it allows buying and selling multiple times. Then, the trader could profit from all the<br>
inter-day gains of the stock, while avoid all the inter-day loss.<br>
Greedy algorithm is sufficient for this problem.<br>
Time Complexity: O(N)<br>

<h2>Code</h2>
<pre><code>
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length-1; ++i) {
            if (prices[i] < prices[i+1]) {
                profit += prices[i+1] - prices[i];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
