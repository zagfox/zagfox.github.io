A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

<h2>Two Pointer</h2>
The idea is to have one pointer at the head and the other pointer at the end of the string. Moving those
two pointers towards the middle until they meet.
Time complexity: O(N)
