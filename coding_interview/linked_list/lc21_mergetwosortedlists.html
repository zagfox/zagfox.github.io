<h1>Leetcode 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists</h1>

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.<br>
Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together<br>
the nodes of the first two lists.<br>
Return the head of the merged linked list.

<h2>Merge sort</h2>
The problem is exactly the same with merge sorting. That there are multiple sorted input streams, merge<br>
them and keep the output also sorted. We'd need to keep a pointer at each input stream, and each time pick<br>
the smallest.

<p>The problem asked the new list is made by splicing together the original nodes. Which makes the sequence<br>
of list operation more tricky (than just creating for the new merged list).</p>

<h2>Java Code</h2>
<pre><code>
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode mergedHead = new ListNode();
        ListNode mergedList = mergedHead;
        while (list1 != null && list2 != null) {
            if (list1.val < list2.val) {
                mergedList.next = list1;
                mergedList = mergedList.next;
                list1 = list1.next;
            } else {
                mergedList.next = list2;
                mergedList = mergedList.next;
                list2 = list2.next;
            }
        }
        // After the while loop, at most one list is non-empty.
        if (list1 != null) {
            mergedList.next = list1;
        } else if (list2 != null) {
            mergedList.next = list2;
        }
        return mergedHead.next;
    }
